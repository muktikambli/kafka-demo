# Kafka Demo Project (Java + Maven)

This project demonstrates a simple **Kafka Producer and Consumer** setup in Java using the Apache Kafka client library.

## 🔧 Features
- One producer and one consumer communicating over a Kafka topic
- Easy to extend for multiple topics
- Configurable via `application.properties`
- Maven-based and Eclipse compatible

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Start your Kafka broker and Zookeeper.
2. Update `bootstrap.servers` in code if needed.
3. Run `App.java` to start producer and consumer.
4. Observe messages being produced and consumed in console.

## 🧱 Future Enhancements
- Add multiple topics and partition handling
- Use JSON serialization for structured messages
- Integrate with Spring Boot for REST-based message publishing
